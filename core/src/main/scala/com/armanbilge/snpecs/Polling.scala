  /** Registers a callback to be notified of read- and write-ready events on a file descriptor.
    * Produces a runnable which unregisters the file descriptor.
    *
    *   1. It is the responsibility of the caller to set the file descriptor to non-blocking mode.
    *   1. It is the responsibility of the caller to unregister the file descriptor when they are
    *      done. There is nobody to cleanup after your mess.
    *   1. A file descriptor should be registered at most once. To modify a registration, you must
    *      unregister and re-register the file descriptor.
    *   1. The callback may be invoked "spuriously" claiming that a file descriptor is read- or
    *      write-ready when in fact it is not. You should be prepared to handle this.
    *   1. The callback will be invoked at least once when the file descriptor transitions from
    *      blocked to read- or write-ready. You may additionally receive zero or more reminders of
    *      its readiness. However, you should not rely on any further callbacks until after the file
    *      descriptor has become blocked again.
